### Imp points - 
- Unopinionated web framework for node.js
- 

### basic server setup - 
- create  a server.js file - file name doe not matter
- import express from express
- this express is a function that we just imported , we need to call the express function and assign it to some variable which will create a instance of application.
- express is a function that returns an instance of an Express application. We call this function and assign the result to a variable like app, which we use to define routes and configure the server.
- our instance of the server is ready, now we need to start the server, for that use listen method of app 

### Understanding Routing -
- Routing in Express refers to determining how an application responds to a client request for a particular endpoint. An endpoint is defined by a path (like '/users') and a specific HTTP method (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- We define routes using methods on our app instance that correspond to HTTP verbs. These methods are app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc.
    - in app.post(), we need to call res method (eg: res.json({})) otherwise if you don't send a response, the client request will hang waiting for a response and It isn’t that POST handlers uniquely require a response—every route handler in Express (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) must either:
        - Send a response (via res.send(), res.json(), res.end(), res.render(), etc.),
        - or call next() so that some later middleware will send one.

### Basic Route Structure -
- Every route follows the same pattern: app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER). Here, METHOD is the HTTP verb (get, post, put, delete), PATH is the URL endpoint, and HANDLER is the function that executes when the route is matched.
- **The handler function receives two main parameters: req (request object) and res (response object). The req object contains information about the HTTP request, while the res object is used to send a response back to the client.** 

### Route Parameters - 
- Route parameters are named URL segments that capture values at their position in the URL. We define them using a colon before the parameter name, like '/users/'. The captured value is then available in req.params.id.
- For multiple parameters, we can chain them like '/users//posts/'. Both values will be available in the req.params object.
- Optional parameters are defined with a question mark after the parameter name, like '/products/?'. This means the route will match both '/products' and '/products/123'.

### Query Parameters - 
- Query parameters are different from route parameters. They appear after the question mark in the URL, like '/search?name=John&age=25'. These are accessed through req.query.name and req.query.age.

### ROute Patterns -
- Express supports various patterns for matching routes. The asterisk () is a wildcard that matches any characters. For example, '/files/' will match any path that starts with '/files/'.
- String patterns can be used for more flexible matching. For instance, '/ab*cd' will match any path that starts with 'ab' and ends with 'cd' with any characters in between.
- Regular expressions can also be used for complex pattern matching, though they're less commonly used in typical applications.

### Middleware in Routing -
- Middleware functions are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They have access to the request object (req), response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle, conventionally denoted by a variable named next.
- In route handling, we can use multiple handler functions by separating them with commas or passing them as an array. Each handler must call next() to pass control to the next handler, or send a response to end the cycle.
- Middleware can be applied globally to all routes using app.use(), or to specific routes by adding them as additional parameters before the final handler.

### Express Router -
- Express Router is a way to create modular, mountable route handlers. A router instance is a complete middleware and routing system, often referred to as a "mini-app".
- We create a router using express.Router(), define routes on it just like we do with the app instance, and then mount it on our main app using app.use() with a path prefix.
- This allows us to organize our routes into separate files or modules, making our code more maintainable and organized.

### Error Handling in Routes -
- When an error occurs in a route handler or middleware, we can pass it to the next function with next(error). This will skip all remaining route callbacks and trigger the error-handling middleware.
- Error-handling middleware is defined just like regular middleware, but with four parameters: err, req, res, and next. Express recognizes these as error handlers because they have four parameters instead of three.

### Route Methods and Chaining - 
- The app.all() method is used to handle all HTTP methods for a particular path. It's useful for applying middleware to all requests to a specific route.
- We can chain route handlers for the same path but different methods using app.route(). This creates a single route definition with multiple handlers attached to different HTTP methods.

### Best Practices -
- Organizing routes in separate files helps maintain clean, readable code. Each file can handle a specific resource or group of related routes.
- Using middleware for common functionality (like authentication, logging, or validation) keeps your route handlers focused on their specific purpose.
- Always validate input parameters to ensure your application receives the expected data format and type.
- Proper error handling prevents your application from crashing and provides meaningful feedback to clients.
- Following RESTful conventions makes your API predictable and easier to understand for other developers.
